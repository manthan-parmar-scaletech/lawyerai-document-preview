Dear Sir/Madam

**USD 350,000,000 term loan facility (the "Facility Agreement") dated on or about the date hereof and made between, amongst others, BB Borrower ltd as borrower (the "Borrower") and Local Bank AG as facility agent (the "Facility Agent")**

1. We refer to the Facility Agreement.

2. Unless otherwise defined in this Fee Letter, terms defined in the Facility Agreement shall have the same meanings in this Fee Letter. The rules of interpretation and construction contained in clause 1.2 (Construction) of the Facility Agreement shall apply to this Fee Letter as if set out in full in this Fee Letter _mutatis mutandis_, and references in those clauses to "this Agreement" or the _Finance Documents_ shall be construed as references to this Fee Letter.

3. This letter is the Upfront Fee Letter.

4. This Upfront Fee Letter is a _Finance Document_ for the purposes of the Facility Agreement.

5. You shall pay to the Facility Agent (for the account of the _Original Lenders_) a fee of USD 20,000 for the _Original Lenders_ extending their Commitments to the Borrower under the Facility Agreement (an "**Upfront Fee**"). Each _Original Lender_ shall be entitled to its pro rata share of the Upfront Fee. Its pro rata share shall be equal to the proportion its Commitment bears to the Total Commitment. The Upfront Fee is payable in two equal instalments of USD 10,000 each.

6. The first instalment of the Upfront Fee is payable on or before the earlier to occur of the date falling three (3) _Business Days_ after the date of the Facility Agreement and the first _Utilisation Date_ under the Facility Agreement. The second instalment is payable on the anniversary of such date.

7. All payments made by you under this Upfront Fee Letter must be made in immediately available, freely transferable and cleared funds by crediting our account (the details of which we have provided you with separately) or such other account as we may notify you in writing with three (3) _Business Days_' prior notice.

8. If any _Tax_ or amount in respect of a _Tax_ must be deducted or withheld from any amount payable or paid by the Borrower on account of or by reference to any payment by or obligation of the Borrower hereunder, the Borrower shall pay such additional amounts as may be necessary to ensure that the recipient of such payment receives a net amount equal to the full amount which we would have received from the Borrower had payment of such _Tax_ not been made.

9. All payments in connection with this Upfront Fee Letter are exclusive of any _value added tax_ or similar charge ("**VAT**"). If VAT is chargeable, the Borrower shall also and at the same time pay to the recipient of the relevant payment an amount equal to the amount of the VAT.

10. The Upfront Fee once paid is non-refundable (in whole or in part) and non-creditable (in whole or in part) against other fees in connection with the Facility Agreement.

11. This Upfront Fee Letter and your rights hereunder may not be assigned by you without our prior written consent.

12. This Upfront Fee Letter may not be amended or waived except as may be agreed in writing by the Facility Agent and the Borrower.

13. This Upfront Fee Letter may be signed in any number of counterparts. This has the same effect as if the signatures on the counterparts were on a single copy of this Upfront Fee Letter.

14. This Upfront Fee Letter and all non-contractual obligations arising from or connected with it are governed by Italian law.

15. Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Italy and waives any defence of forum non conveniens which may be available.

16. Clause 36 (Enforcement) of the Facility Agreement shall apply to this Upfront Fee Letter as if set out in full in this Fee Letter _mutatis mutandis_, and references in those clauses to "this Agreement" or the Finance Documents shall be construed as references to this Upfront Fee Letter.

By signing and returning a copy of this Upfront Fee Letter to the Facility Agent, you acknowledge your agreement to its terms.

Yours faithfully
